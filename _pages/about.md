Hi! My name is Dillon Qui√±ones and I am a second-year graduate student in the Master of Science in Psychological Science program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Currently, I am working with Drs. [Diane Beck](https://becklab.beckman.illinois.edu/) and [Lili Sahakyan](https://sahakyanlab.weebly.com/) studying the relationships among cognition, perception, and attention. A primary interest of mine is understanding the effects of probability manipulations on visual memory.
