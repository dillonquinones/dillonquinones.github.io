Hi! My name is Dillon Qui√±ones and I am a second-year graduate student in the Master of Science in Psychological Science program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Currently, I am working with Drs. [Diane Beck](https://becklab.beckman.illinois.edu/) and [Lili Sahakyan](https://sahakyanlab.weebly.com/) studying the relationships among cognition, perception, and attention. A primary interst of mine is understanding the effects of probability manipulations on visual memory.

You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
